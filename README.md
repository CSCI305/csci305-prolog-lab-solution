### CSCI 305, Spring 2018

# Due Date: April 30, 2018 at Midnight

# Prolog

For this lab, you will use Prolog. I expect you to use the prolog installed in the VM provided for the course, but you can also install it on Windows, Mac, and Linux by downloading from here: http://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable. Prolog is also installed on the departmental lab Linux machines.

# Dataset

Begin by downloading the file `royal.pro` form BrightSpace. This data was adapted from http://ftp.aset.psu.edu/~saw/royal/. This file is a set of Prolog facts that represents the genealogy of the royal House of Windsor.

# Getting Started

Next, create a new file `[lastname]_[firstname].prolog2.pro`. This file should be in the same directory as `royal.pro`. In this file, you will include all your Prolog rules you will be asked to write in the lab.

Your program should begin with your name as a comment.

```prolog
 % First_name Last_name
 % CSCI 305 Prolog Lab 2
```

# Warmup

Check that everything is working. First load the `royal.pro` file by choosing `File -> Consult` and choosing the file. Next, load the file you created above in SWI-Prolog.

Now, run the query:

```prolog
 ?- parent(X, 'Queen Elizabeth II').
```

The symbol `?-` is the Prolog query prompt. You do not need to retype this. This query asks who is the parent of Queen Elizabeth II. Prolog first returns the result `X = 'King George VI'`. Type a semicolon (;). This will prompt Prolog for the next result. Prolog then returns `X = 'Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon'.` The period following the second result indicates there are no additional results.

The entire query and result interaction should appear as:

```prolog
 ?- parent(X, 'Queen Elizabeth II').
 X = 'King George VI' ;
 X = 'Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon'.
```

Replicate this exchange on your own machine.

# Parents

In this lab you will create a number of Prolog rules that define a number of common familial relationships.

In Prolog parlance, we define a rule as its name and its arity. For instance the rule `mother/2` indicates a rule named `mother` with two arguments.

```prolog
 mother(M,C):- parent(M,C), female(M).
```

Add this rule to your Prolog file. Reload your file. Test your new rule with the query:

```prolog
 ?- mother(X, 'Queen Elizabeth II').
```

which should return the single result:

```prolog
 X = 'Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lynon'.
```

Now write the rule `father/2` and add it to your file.

# More Rules

Now write a set of additional rules. In your rules, you are encouraged to make use of other rules you have written. This may effect the order you choose to implement these rules.

Make sure you get the order of the arguments correct as switching then will change the meaning of the function.

* `spouse/2`
* `child/2`
* `son/2`
* `daughter/2`
* `sibling/2`
* `brother/2`
* `sister/2`
* `uncle/2` (two rules: one by blood, one by marriage.)
* `aunt/2` (two rules: one by blood, one by marriage.)
* `grandparent/2`
* `grandfather/2`
* `grandmother/2`
* `grandchile/2`


For the next two rules, make use of rules you have already written. It may take more than one rule to define these functions. You may find tracing useful. To debug, you can use the keyword `trace` to enable tracing and `notrace` to disable.

Write the rules:

* `ancestor/2` (`ancestor(X, Y)` means `X` is the ancestor of `Y`)
* `descendant/2` (`descendant(X, Y)` means `X` is the descendant of `Y`)

# Numbers in Prolog

Now we will write some Prolog rules that require numeric comparisons. Write the rules:

* `older/2`
* `younger/2`

The rule `older(X, Y)` indicates person `X` is older than person `Y`. The rule `younger/2` should be written in a similar manner.

Lastly, write the rule `regentWhenBorn/2`. This rule, `regentWhenBorn(X, Y)`, should ask who was King or Queen (X) when person Y was born.

# Extra Credit (10 pts)

Write rule(x) that define the first cousin relationship, `cousin/2`. You should look up the formal definition of cousin. You do not need to support second or third cousins, nor cousins removed.

EC1. What is the result of query:

 ```prolog
  ?- cousin(X, 'Charles, Prince of Wales').
 ```

EC2. What is the result of query:
 ```prolog
  ?- cousin('Charles, Prince of Wales', X).
 ```

Enable tracing and run both of these queries again.

EC3. Which resulted in more steps? Explain why. Provide both of these traces in a file `[lastname]_[firstname].prolog2.ec.trace.txt`.

# Lab Questions

For these lab questions, you are expected to use Prolog to answer. Answers that are given without providing the Prolog rules that derive it will receive no credit. Some queries have multiple answers and you are expected to provide all results to the lab questions. Use the semicolon (;) to prompt Prolog for additional results. However, you may omit duplicate results, if the same name appears more than once in your result set.

1. What is the result of query: `?- father(X, 'Queen Elizabeth II').`?
2. What is the result of query: `?- grandmother(X, 'Queen Elizabeth II').`?
3. What is the result of query: `?- grandfather(X, 'Queen Elizabeth II').`?
4. What is the result of query: `?- grandparent(X, 'Queen Elizabeth II').`?
5. What is the result of query: `?- grandparent('Queen Elizabeth II', X).`?
6. What is the result of query: `?- sibling(X, 'Queen Elizabeth II').`?
7. What is the result of query: `?- son(X, 'Queen Elizabeth II').`?
8. What is the result of query: `?- daughter(X, 'Queen Elizabeth II').`?
9. What is the result of query: `?- aunt(X, 'Lady Diana Spencer').`?
10. What is the result of query: `?- spouse(X, 'Prince William').`?
11. What is the result of query: `?- ancestor(X, 'Prince Henry').`?
12. What is the result of query: `?- descendant('Queen Victoria', Y).`?
13. What is the result of query: `?- older('Prince Henry', 'Prince William').`?
14. What is the result of query: `?- older(X, 'Queen Elizabeth II').`?
15. What is the result of query: `?- regentWhenBorn(X, 'Queen Elizabeth II').`?

# Troubleshooting

This lab requires an independent study of the Prolog language. You are encouraged to use any web tutorials and resources to learn Prolog. Given the size of the class, I will not be able to debug your code for you. Please do not send panicked emails requesting I fix your bug for you. Allow yourself plenty of time, and use patience, perseverance, and the Internet to debug your code. I will gladly answer clarifying questions about the goals and instructions of the Lab assignment.

# Lab Questions

The following questions are for feedback and evaluation purposes. Points are awarded for any sincere answer.

16. Name something you like about Prolog. Explain.
17. Name something you dislike about Prolog. Explain.
18. Did you enjoy this lab? Which aspects did you like and/or dislike?
19. Approximately how many hours did you spend on this lab?
20. Do you think you will use Prolog again? For which type(s) of project(s)?

# Submission

Each student will complete and submit this assignment individually or in a two-person team. Do not consult with others. However, you are encouraged to use the Internet to learn any aspect of Prolog you need to complete the assignment, but not to answer the questions asked in this lab.

Comment your program heavily. Intelligent comments and a clean, readable formatting of your code accounts for 20% of your grade.

Save the final version of your program and zip the source code into a file named `[lastname]_[firstname].prolog_lab.zip`. Type your lab questions in plain text as `[lastname]_[firstname].prolog_lab.txt`. Include your name in the text file.

We must be able to run your program from the command line with no arguments.

Submit your files to the Java Program 2 dropbox folder on BrightSpace. Submit your files before the due date as late submissions will not be accepted.
